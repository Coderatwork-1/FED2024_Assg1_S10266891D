About this project
This project is for my FED assigment 1 and is about a website for a company or any other revamp.I chose the  anime series BAKUGAN as i felt that it would be unqiue from the rest of websites like portfolios and e-commerces.Also, this website has a ring of nostalgia as most of us would have seen this during our childhood.

Design Process
This website is catered for those who love Bakugan , love anime, want to try anime, want to revisit their childhood and for those who really want to know more about Bakugan.I chose the background to be a black and red linear gradient as it really supports the colours in the Bakugan logo.I then thought of 3 pages: the homepage , the about page and the watch page.The home page showcases the highlighted points in a more fun, engaging and attractive manner with navigation to the other 2 pages.The about page consists of the inages of the main characher and his friends  and their partner Bakugan.
The goal of this website is for people to recall their childhood memories and smile, people to learn more and watch this amazing anime series.

Features
1. NAVIGATION in the header from homepage to aboutpage to watchpage , vice versa.
2. clickable and transitioned bakugan logo

Technologies Used:
1.HTML (3 files named index.html, about.html and watch.html)
2. CSS (1 file named style.css)
3. Javascript (1 file named script.js)

Testing
1. Homepage
   Navigate  to aboutpage and watchpage by clicking on the 'home' 'about' and 'watch' text in the header in the homepage easily.
   Can see the bakugan logo transition forward when the cursor is put there.

2. AboutPage
  Navigate to homepage and watchpage by clicking on the 'home' 'about' and 'watch' text in the header in the aboutpage easily.
  Can see the bakugan logo transition forward when the cursor is put there.


3. WatchPage
   Can click and view on the videos embedded easily and change the quality and presence of caption when need be.
   Can see the bakugan logo transition forward when the cursor is put there easily.
   Navigate to homepage and watchpage by clicking on the 'home' 'about' and 'watch' text in the header in the watchpage easily.

Challenges faced and errors was getting the exact gradient output,  excueting animation and transition effects for the texts , logos in the html files and  getting the navigation through the website to work smoothly using javascript.
