            <h2> Episode 1:The Battle Begins</h2>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iLlyPxChcHo?si=KoiXg7KTH6CSIK1j" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>The battle begins when the story of how the game of bakugan was created with the help of Dan Kuso and many other children, and how it quickly became popular around the world. 
            Dan faces Akira's older brother as Drago and a mysterious white dragon fight in Vestroia, with the dragon destroying itself by getting to close to the core of Vestroia. Dan quickly beats his opponent, but in a rematch, things are far more heated. 
            Drago and a Darkus Bakugan fight it out, with Dan watching them. Their fight gets interrupted as Drago's fight gets in the way, and Dan then gets Drago in the fight and gives him his name.</p>


            <h3>Episode 2: Masquerade Ball</h3>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_dPVwq5f3dw?si=eT2bsCF4ABymyOhC" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>
               Dan goes to school and attempts to show that Drago can talk, but only ends up getting in trouble.
               Drago tries to get away in the panic, but gets caught by the teacher. 
               When Dan gets back, he is told by Runo that she lost a battle to Masquerade and lost her Bakugan because he took them. 
               The others talk about the mysterious new brawler as Dan decides he will fight him. Akira comes back for another rematch and loses. Masquerade comes and they start the fight, but it is not even a challenge for him as he quickly dispatches Dan with the "Doom Card" that stops all abilities. </p>
